3-stage architecture:

1. Working directory: all the files that you have in your project
2. Staging area: An area between repo and working directory, here the snapshot of all the files
are moved before actually moving them to repo
3. Repo: Our actual storage area

Git status:
tells the status of repo,
.untracked files
.files that are in staging area but not in repo yet
.it doesn't tell us about files in staging area which

Github:
for each local repo your must have a unique individual remote repo

1. create a new remote repo
2.
3. git remote add origin URL
4. git branch -M main (naming your branch)
5. git push -u origin main (first time only, after that just git push)

git remote remove origin
to remove the connection of local with remote
