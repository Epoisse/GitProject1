3-stage architecture:

1. Working directory: all the files that you have in your project
2. Staging area: An area between repo and working directory, here the snapshot of all the files
are moved before actually moving them to repo
3. Repo: Our actual storage area

Git status:
tells the status of repo,
.untracked files
.files that are in staging area but not in repo yet
.it doesn't tell us about
